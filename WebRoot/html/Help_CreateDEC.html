            A Data Element Concept is the thing (or concept) in
            the real world that you want to represent. ISO/IEC
            11179 defines Data Element Concept as an idea that
            can be represented in the form of a data element,
            described independently of any particular
            representation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Like other primary functions of the Curation Tool,
            Data Element Concept curation features are accessed
            via the dark blue Navigation Bar at the top of the
            screen. Figure 1 illustrates where to access these
            features. You may also want to create a new Data
            Element Concept using an existing Data Element
            Concept as a starting template or version an existing
            Data Element Concept. Both of these options can be
            accessed via the <b><span class="navigation">Create

            "FONT-FAMILY: wingdings">&#232;</span>Data Element

          <p>
            The ISO 11179 Standard describes a Data Element
            Concept as the combination of an Object Class, a
            Property, and Qualifiers for each. Definitions for
            each of these terms are documented below.

            <span class="figureText">Data Element
            Concept</span><br>
            The ISO/IEC 11179 Standard describes a Data Element
            Concept as relating several data elements that record
            data about that concept with different
            representations. For example, a concept of
            PersonPlaceOfBirth is a Data Element Concept. A Data
            Element Concept is composed of an Object Class, a
            Property and optional Qualifiers for both.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="figureText">Object Class</span><br>
            The ISO 11179 Standard describes an Object Class as
            &#8216;a set of ideas, abstractions, or things in the
            real world that can be identified with explicit
            boundaries and meaning and whose properties and
            behavior follow the same rules&#8217;. In other
            words, Object Classes are the &#8216;things about
            which you want to store and collect data.&#8217;
            Examples of Object Classes include cars, persons,
            households, employees, etc. For the example of
            PersonPlaceOfBirth, an Object class is Person.

            <span class="figureText">Property</span><br>
            The ISO 11179 Standard describes a Property as
            &#8216;a peculiarity common to all members of an
            object class&#8217;. In other words, properties are
            &#8216;what humans use to describe or distinguish
            Objects&#8217;. For the example given above, a
            Property is PlaceOfBirth.

          <p>
            <span class="figureText">Qualifiers</span><br>
            The ISO 11179 Standard describes qualifiers as being
            used to &#8216;differentiate between names (i.e.
            Object Class and Property combinations) that would
            otherwise be the same&#8217;. For the example of
            PersonPlaceOfBirth, a Qualifier of year is used to
            indicate a specific year.

          <p>
            Data Element Concepts are named by combining Primary
            and Qualifier Concepts for Object Classes and
            Properties. The Object Classes and Properties are
            then used for naming the Data Element Concept. This
            approach is new for version 3.0 of the CDE Curation
            Tool.

          <h4>
            Building Blocks for Object Classes and Properties
          </h4>
          <p>
            Object Classes and Properties are the building blocks
            from which a Data Element Concept name is made. The
            CDE Curation Tool enables you to search caDSR and the
            NCI EVS (Enterprise Vocabulary Services) for
            Concepts. The Primary Concepts may represent existing
            Object Classes and Properties, or Concepts may be
            combined to create new Object Classes and Properties.
            Object Class and Property Long Names are also created
            from this interface.
          </p>
          <p>
            An Object Class or Property may consist of one
            Primary Concept and one or more Qualifier Concepts.
            Each of these Concepts must be selected separately.
            Once selected the Concept's source database and
            Concept Code will be shown below the Concept. You may
            highlight Qualifier Concepts one at a time to see
            their source database and Concept Code.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Object Class and Property Long Names will be
            constructed from the names of the Qualifier and
            Primary Concepts that have been chosen. The Long Name
            will be built left to right starting with the Concept
            at the top of the Qualifier Concepts list and ending
            with the Primary Concept. Once you have built the
            Object Class and Property Long Names they are not
            editable.
          </p>
          <p>
            Please note that if you select only a Primary Concept
            from the caDSR database and select no Qualifier
            Concepts you have in effect selected an existing
            Object Class (or Property). In this case, no new
            Object Class (or Property) will be created in caDSR
            when you submit your Data Element Concept.

            Searching for Building Blocks using the regular Term
            Search is very similar to searching for any other
            Administered Component. The first step in naming a
            Data Element Concept is to search for and choose the
            optional building blocks (Primary and Qualifier
            Concepts for Object Class and Property) that will
            ultimately comprise the Data Element Concept Long
            Name.

            Subconcepts of their own which may be seen by
            clicking on a plus sign that appears next to the
            Subconcept name. If no plus sign appears then the
            Subconcept has no Subconcepts of its own.

            name. The Concept's details will appear in the Search
            Results window to the right. The Concept may appear
            more than once if it has multiple definitions. There
            will be one row for each definition. If no definition
            is associated with the Concept, the definition field

            its Concept Name. When a Concept is selected in this
            way several options are enabled. The Concept may be

            There are three options for creating a Data Element
            Concept Short Name. It is strongly suggested that you
            accept the default System Generated Short Name. This
            name will be a combination of the Object Class Public
            ID and Version with the Property Public ID and
            Version, although the Short Name field will simply
            say &#8216;(Generated by the System).&#8217; If you
            want you may select an &#8216;Abbreviated&#8217;
            Short Name. This Short Name type will consists of the
            first four letters of each building block Concept
            selected for the Object Class and the Property,
            separated by the character &#8216;_&#8217;. If the
            Preferred Name is longer than 30 characters it will be
            truncated to 30 characters. The final Short Name
            option is &#8216;Existing Name (editable).&#8217;
            When you choose this option you type a Short Name into
            the field, up to the 30 character limit. If you
            selected no Object Class or Property you must use an
            &#8216;Existing Name&#8217; type of Short Name.

            <b>caDSR database limits</b> for Long Name and Short
            Name. The DEC Long Name is drafted in this box.
            However, you may edit the name manually by entering
            text. The system automatically generated a DEC Short
            Name using IDs and versions. However, you may choose
            to use a name abbreviated from the Object Class and
            Property, or you may manually enter a Short Name if
            you wish. The caDSR database length limit for Long
            Name is 255 characters. The caDSR database length
            limit for Short Name is 30 characters. Context
            Administrators may choose to set shorter length
            limits (not enforced by this tool) if desired.

            The CDE Curation Tool provides you with two options
            for defining a Data Element Concept. Each of these
            options is described in detail below. The tool

            You may edit the draft definition or create a

            In this example the Conceptual Domain for the block
            of Data Element Concepts is being changed to Adverse
            Events - CTEP. When you select the Validation action,
            the Data Element Concept Block Edit Validation screen
            appears.
          </p>
          <p>
            Click the Back button if any of the attributes are
            determined to be invalid. This action will return to
            the Block Edit window where you can correct the
            invalid attribute(s).
          </p>
          <p>
            Attributes that were not modified will have a
            Validation Status of "No Change". If any attributes
            are invalid, the Validation screen will indicate in
            what way the attribute is invalid and the Submit
            button will be disabled. Invalid attributes can be
            corrected by going back to the Block Edit screen and
            modifying the values of the attributes. If all the
            attributes are valid the Submit button will be
            enabled. Select the Submit button to save your
            changes to the caDSR.
