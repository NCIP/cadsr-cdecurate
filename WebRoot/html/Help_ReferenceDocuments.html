    <TD colSpan=2>Once you have created a Reference Document for a Data 
      Element, Value Domain or Data Element Concepts, you can attach files to 
      that Reference Document. The attachments are uploaded for Reference 
      Document by using the Upload Document(s) button on the search screen. The 
      Upload Document(s) button brings up the Reference Document Attachments 
      page. On the Reference Document Attachments page you can view any 
      attachments and add or delete attachments to Reference Document in 
      contexts that you have write permissions.  </TD></TR>
