	<hr>
	<p>A wealth of clinical and scientific and clinical research data
			 exists within the cancer research community. The NCI's Center for
			 Bioinformatics (NCICB) has developed an evolving core infrastructure
			 designed to provide the ability to seamlessly translate and
			 interchange semantically immutable information. The caCORE
			 infrastructure provides researchers, developers and statisticians
			 with the ability to plug their existing data, sources and methods
			 into a standardized sharable framework that supports information
			 exchange, regardless of source, location or format.
	</p>
	<p>Different biomedical domains have their own terminologies and
			ontological resources, each focused on different concepts within
			their domain. A common terminology is the foundation for
			interoperability between systems, indexing repositories of
			information, and querying and integrating information sources
			across research areas. The Enterprise Vocabulary Services (EVS)
			is a set of vocabulary resources that are being used to provide a
			common terminology across the cancer research domain, improving
			communication between the people, organizations, data and data
			sources in it.
	</p>
	<p>NCICB's clinical trials informatics efforts draw on EVS
			whenever domain terminology is required. This reliance on
			controlled vocabulary ensures that term meanings remain clear and
			can be related to other terms with similar concepts.
	</p>
	<p>The EVS Project is a collaborative effort of the Center for
			Bioinformatics and the NCI Office of Communications. EVS includes
			Distributed Terminology System (DTS) Vocabularies and the NCI
			Metathesaurus. The DTS Vocabularies include:
	</p>
		<ul>
				<li><b>NCI Thesaurus:</b> a biomedical thesaurus created
									 specifically to meet the needs of the NCI, is produced by the NCI
									 EVS project. This knowledgebase contains the working vocabulary
									 used in NCI data systems. It covers clinical, translational and
									 basic research as well as administrative terminology. 
				</li>
				<li><b>GO:</b> GO Ontology, published by the Gene Ontology
									Consortium.
				</li>
				<li><b>VA NDFRT:</b> Published by the US Veterans'
									Administration, the National Drug File Reference Terminology
									covers clinical drugs used at the VA.
				</li>
				<li><b>LOINC:</b> Published by the Regenstrief Institute, the
									Logical Observation Identifier Names and Codes covers clinical
									laboratory terminology. 
				</li>
				<li><b>MGED Ontology:</b> The MGED (Microarray Gene Expression
									Data) Ontology, produced by the MGED Society, contains concepts,
									definitions, terms, and resources for standardized description of
									a microarray experiment in support of MAGE v.1. The MGED ontology
									is divided into the MGED Core ontology which is intended to be
									stable and in synch with MAGE v.1; and the MGED Extended ontology
									which adds further associations and classes not found in MAGEv.1.
				</li>
				<li><b>MedDRA:</b> MedDRA (Medical Dictionary for Regulatory
									Activities) is an international medical terminology developed
									under the auspices of the International Conference on
									Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Registration of
									Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH).
				</li>
				<li><b>SnoMed:</b> SnoMed is the universal health care
									terminology maintained by SNOMED&reg; International, a division
									of the College of American Pathologists (CAP).
				</li>
			</ul>
			The EVS Project also produces the NCI Metathesaurus, which is
			based on NLM's Unified Medical Language System Metathesaurus
			supplemented with additional cancer-centric vocabulary. The
			public version of NCI Metathesaurus currently contains all public
			domain vocabularies from the National Library of Medicine's UMLS
			Metathesaurus, as well as a growing number of NCI-specific
			vocabularies developed by the National Cancer Institute.<br>
			<br>
			In the CDE Curation Tool, the EVS Vocabularies can be searched
			for primary and qualifier concepts that can be used to create
 			the names for Object Class, Property, and
			Representation Terms. These are the building blocks for Data
			Element Concepts and Value Domains. EVS Vocabularies are also
			searched when creating Parent Concepts and Value Meanings for Value Domains.

		 <h4>Search EVS
		 </h4>
		 <p>The NCI Thesaurus and Metathesaurus search screen is accessed
		 by clicking the Search links for the individual building
		 block (i.e. Object class, Property (DEC and VD) or Representation Term (VD)), 
		 and for the  Parent Concept and Value Meanings field on the create or edit Value
		 Domain screens. Following are detailed instructions
		 about how to search the NCI Thesaurus and Metathesaurus.
		 <span class="figureText">Figure 1</span> is an overview of the
		 EVS Search screen when searching for an Object Class. All search
		 screens have similar layouts and functionality.</p>
		 <p class="centeredImage">

		 		Search EVS for an Object Class
		 </p>
		 <h4>Naming a Data Element Concept
		 </h4>
		 <p>Object Classes and Properties are the building blocks from
		 			which a Data Element Concept name is made. When creating a new
		 			Data Element Concept, the use of Object Classes and Properties is
		 			strongly encouraged but not strictly mandatory. The CDE Curation
					Tool enables you to search caDSR and the NCI EVS (Enterprise
					Vocabulary Services) for Concepts. The Primary Concepts may
					represent existing Object Classes and Properties, or Concepts may
					be combined to create new Object Classes and Properties. Object
					Class and Property Long Names are also created from this
					interface.<br>
					<br>
					An Object Class or Property may consist of one Primary Concept
					and one or more Qualifier Concepts. Each of these Concepts must
					be selected separately. Once selected, the Concept's source
					database and Concept Code will be shown below the Concept. You
					may highlight Qualifier Concepts one at a time to see their
					source database and Concept Code.<br>
					<br>
					The Object Class and Property Long Names will be constructed from
					the names of the Qualifier and Primary Concepts that have been
					chosen. The Long Name will be built left to right starting with
					the Concept at the top of the Qualifier Concepts list and ending
					with the Primary Concept. Once you have built the Object Class
					and Property Long Names they are not editable.<br>
					<br>
					Please note that if you select only a Primary Concept from the
					caDSR database and select no Qualifier Concepts you have in
					effect selected an existing Object Class (or Property). In this
					case, no new Object Class (or Property) will be created in caDSR
					when you submit your Data Element Concept.<br>
					<br>
			</p>
		<h4>Naming a Value Domain
		</h4>
			<p>Representation Term is the building block from which a Value
					Domain name is made. When creating a new Value Domain, the use of
					a Representation Term is strongly encouraged but not strictly
					mandatory. The CDE Curation Tool enables you to search caDSR and
					the NCI EVS (Enterprise Vocabulary Services) for Concepts.
					The Primary Concepts may represent existing Representation Terms,
					or Concepts may be combined to create a new Representation Term.
					The Representation Term Long Name is also created from this
					interface.<br>
					<br>
					A Representation Term may consist of one Primary Concept and one
					or more Qualifier Concepts. Each of these must be selected
					separately. Once selected the Concept's source database and
					Concept Code will be shown below the Concept. You may highlight
					Qualifier Concepts one at a time to see their source database and
					Concept Code.<br>
					<br>
					The Representation Term Long Names will be constructed from the
					names of the Qualifier and Primary Concepts that have been
					chosen. The Long Name will be built left to right starting with
					the Object Class and ending with the Primary Concept. Once you
					have built the Representation Term Long Name, it is not editable.
					Optionally, a user may choose to search for Object Class and
					Properties to assist in the creation of a Value Domain's Long
					Name.<br>
					<br>
					Please note that if you select only a Primary Concept from the
					caDSR database and select no Qualifier Concepts you have in
					effect selected an existing Representation Term. In this case, no
					new Representation Term will be created in caDSR when you submit
					your Value Domain.
			</p>
			<h4>Naming a Value Meaning
		</h4>
			<p>
			A Value Meaning is the meaning or semantic content of a Permissible Value.
			A Value Meaning may consist of one Primary Concept and one or more Qualifier 
			Concepts. Each of these must be selected separately. Once selected the 
			Concept's source database and Concept Code will be shown next to the Concept in the PV table. 
			<br>
			<br>
			The Value Meaning Name will be constructed from the names of the Qualifier 
			and Primary Concepts that have been chosen. The Name will be built left to 
			right starting with the Qualifier Concepts and ending with the Primary Concept.

		<span class="standOutHeading">Search EVS for Concepts (Primary, Qualifier and Parent
 					Concepts) via Term Search</span>
	<hr>
			<p>Searching EVS for Concepts using the regular Term Search is
			very similar to searching for any other Administered Component in the CDE Curation Tool.
			</p>
			<p>To Search EVS using the Term Search:
				<ul>
						<li>Select the EVS Vocabulary.
						</li>
						<li>Select what to Search In (Synonym, Concept Code/CUI or Code).
						</li>
						<li>Enter a Search Term or Click the link for a Tree-based Search.
						</li>
						<li>Select EVS Filters.

			 EVS Tree Search Hyperlink
		</p>
		<p>When the Tree Search first appears all of the NCI Thesaurus
						Root Concepts will appear on the left side of the screen. Each
						Root Concept may have one or more Subconcepts. A Concept's
						Subconcepts may be seen by clicking on the plus sign next to the
						Concept name. Some Subconcepts will have Subconcepts of their own
						which may be seen by clicking on a plus sign that appears next to
						the Subconcept name. If no plus sign appears then the Subconcept
						has no Subconcepts of its own.<br>
						<br>
						To select a Root Concept or Subconcept, click on its name. The
						Concept's details will appear in the Search Results window to the
						right. The Concept may appear more than once if it has multiple
						definitions. There will be one row for each definition. If no
						definition is associated with the Concept, the definition field
						will read &lsquo;No Value Exists.&rsquo;<br>
						<br>
						Once Concepts appear in the Search Results area, one may be
						selected by clicking on the check box next to its Concept Name.
						When a Concept is selected in this way several options are
						enabled. The Concept may be used for your Data Element Concept by
						clicking on the <input style="WIDTH: 120px" type="button" value=
            "Use Selection" name="editSelectedBtn">button above the
						search results. A Concept's Subconcepts may be retrieved to the

			<span class="standOutHeading">caDSR Business Rules for Concept Selection</span>
			<hr>
			<p>When selecting EVS Concepts for caDSR metadata (e.g. Object Class, Property, 
			Representation Term, Permissible Value, Value Meaning, and all Qualifier and Primary), 
			there are a few business rules to be aware of. 
			</p>
			<p>For all concept searches (e.g. Object Class, Property, Representation Term, Permissible Value,
			Value Meaning, and all Qualifier and Primary), if the selected concept is from Metathesaurus
			but also exists in the NCI Thesaurus, the Curation Tool will use the concept name
			and definition from NCI Thesaurus. A message is displayed stating that the NCI 
			Thesaurus concept will be used.
			</p>
			<p class="centeredImage"><img alt="image009" src="../images/Help/EVS/image009.png" 
				 class="screenShot" />
			</p>
			<p class="imageText">FIGURE 9<br>
				 Metathesaurus Concept Replaced by Thesaurus Concept
			</p>
			<p>For all concept searches, if the selected 
			concept name or definition already exists in the caDSR, the Curation 
			Tool will use the caDSR name or definition regardless of the source
			of the selected concept.
			</p>
			<p class="centeredImage"><img alt="image010" src="../images/Help/EVS/image010.png" 
				 class="screenShot" />
			</p>
			<p class="imageText">FIGURE 10<br>
				 Selected Concept Replaced by caDSR
			</p>
			<p>When selecting multiple concepts to use for Permissible Values, there is an additional
			rule. If duplicate concepts are selected, the Curation Tool will use the concept
			from the NCI Thesaurus in a preferred order. Users have the ability to de-select unwanted
			duplicate concepts to use the desired concept.
			</p>
			<p class="centeredImage"><img alt="image011" src="../images/Help/EVS/image011.png"

			</p>
			<p>When selecting a concept to use for a Value Meaning, if the concept already exists
			in the caDSR, a warning message will be displayed on the validation page stating
			that the Curation Tool will use the existing Value Meaning and that one or more of 
			the attributes may not match the selected concept. The user has the option to go back 
			and modify their selection.
