            The CDE Curation Tool has an easy-to-use Search
            screen to help you identify and retrieve existing
            Administered Components from the caDSR. The tool
            supports <span class="standOut">Search</span> and
            <span class="standOut">Create/Edit</span>
            capabilities for the following Administered
            Components:

          <ul>
            <li>Term search is not case sensitive.
            </li>
            <li>The search 'wild card' is an asterisk: * . (For
            example, to find all terms that start with the letter
            'A', you would enter 'A*' in the search field.)
            </li>
            <li>During searches of the NCI Enterprise Vocabulary
            System (EVS), the maximum number of search results
            returned from the Metathesaurus is 750. The limit can
            be set to 100, 250, 500, or 750 records.

            Filtering your search means that you are entering
            additional information about what Administered
            Components you are seeking. Filtering will
            potentially reduce the number of search results
            returned and increase the likelihood that the results
            contain what you seek. Simple and/or Advanced Filters
            are included on most search pages.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Simple and Advanced Filters:</b> The Advanced
            Filter includes date created, date modified, creator,
            and modifier to assist the user find the exact term

            Anything entered in the Advanced Filter will not
            affect the search results if the search is started
            from the Simple Filter. The Advanced Filter allows you
            to filter by All Creators/Modifiers, by Derivation
            Type and by Version number. You can also filter by
            Date Created or Modified by entering the date in the
            format displayed or by clicking the calendar icon and
            selecting a date. The <span style=

            The Curation Tool now provides you with the ability
            to search for Administered Components by one or more
            Contexts. To do this, left-click on the first context
            (from the lists of Contexts in item 4 of the Search
            interface), then press and hold down the [Ctrl]
            button on your keyboard. Left-click again to select
            additional Contexts from the list.
          </p>
          <p>
            Additionally, users now have the ability to filter
            their search by a specific version. Located next to
            the 'All' and 'Latest' radio buttons in the Search
            interface, the third radio button is next to a text
            field. Enter the version number of the desired
            Administered Component(s) into the text field.
            Version number should be entered as a positive
            number, with or without a decimal.

            You may also append search results (i.e. keep a set
            of search results, conduct a new search, and add the
            new results to the total list). To keep selected
            records from a search result and append records from
            additional searches:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Perform a search and choose the records to keep

            <li>Perform another search of the same type of

            </li>
            <li>Repeat these steps until you have all the records
            you are interested in
            </li>
          </ol>Append only works for one type of Administered
          Component at a time (i.e. Data Element, Data Element

          append search results from a Value Domain search to a
          Data Element search result.<br>
