                ISO/IEC 11179 Standard</a> (text taken from

            ISO (International Organization for Standardization)
            and IEC (the International Electrotechnical
            Commission) form the specialized system for worldwide
            standardization. ISO/IEC 11179 describes the
            standardizing and registering of data elements to
            make data understandable and shareable.<br>
            <br>
            The purpose of ISO/IEC 11179 is to give concrete
            guidance on the formulation and maintenance of
            discrete data element descriptions and semantic
            content (metadata) that shall be used to formulate
            data elements in a consistent, standard manner.

          <p>
            Humans are aware of anything that exists in the
            natural world through its properties. Data represents
            the properties of these things. A data element is a
            special member of the broad notion called data.
          </p>
          <p>
            Specifications of data elements, the basic units of
            data, involves documenting relevant characteristics
            of each data element to ensure its representation of
            the natural world item is consistent and accurate.
          </p>
          <p>
            Data that has been carefully specified and
            standardized greatly enhances its usefulness and
            share-ability across systems and environments.
            Sharing data involves the ability to locate desired
            data, retrieve the data, and to exchange the data
            with others. When data elements are well documented,
            and the documentation is managed in a Data Element
            Registry, finding and retrieving them from disparate
            databases as well as sending and receiving them via
            electronic communications are made easier.
          </p>
          <p>
            Data Elements are the fundamental units of data an
            organization manages. When an organization needs to
            transfer data to another organization, data elements
            are the fundamental units that make up the
            transaction sets.
          </p>Data Elements are composed of three parts:<br>
          <ul>
            <li>Object Class: a set of ideas, abstractions, or
            things in the real world that can be identified with
            explicit boundaries and meaning and whose properties
            and behavior follow the same rules.
            </li>
            <li style="list-style: none">
              <br>
            </li>
            <li>Property: is a peculiarity common to all members
            of an object class
            </li>
            <li style="list-style: none">
              <br>
            </li>
            <li>Representation: describes how the data are
            represented, i.e. the combination of a value domain,
            data type, and if necessary, a unit of measure or a
            character set.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The combination of an Object Class and a Property
            results in a Data Element Concept. A Value Domain
            includes the Values and Value Meanings (i.e.
            Representation) of the Data Element.
          </p>
          <p>
            In other words, a Data Element is the result of
            combining two Administered Components: a Data Element
            Concept (the idea you are trying to represent) and a
            Value Domain (how it should be represented).

            ISO 11179 defines an administered component as a
            component for which administrative attributes are
            collected. Administered Components include: Data
            Element Concept, Value Domain, Data Element, Object
            Class, Property, Representation Term, Conceptual
            Domain, Classification Scheme, and Context.

          <p>
            The caDSR implementation of the ISO/IEC 11179
            Standard, while it includes NCICB-specific
            extensions, still maps to the mandatory and optional
            metadata items prescribed by ISO/IEC 11179, Part 3.
            There are various levels of conformance for ISO/IEC
            11179 compliance. Because of NCICB's business needs
            related extensions, caDSR is considered
            &ldquo;conforming&rdquo; as opposed to
            &ldquo;strictly conforming&rdquo; to the ISO/IEC
            11179 Standard.
          </p>
          <h4>

                Enterprise Vocabulary Services (EVS)</a>
          </h4>
          <p>
            A Data Element is formed by a concept that takes on a
            specific representation. In ISO/IEC 11179 terms, this
            translates into the combination of a specific Data
            Element Concept and a specific Value Domain. caDSR
            administered items are backed by the use of
            externally defined terminologies and controlled
            vocabularies. With UMLS as a framework, NCI has
            developed vocabulary services that are accessed via
            API (application to application interfaces) to
            provide touch points during creation of content. This
            results in administered components that are bound to
            immutable concept codes. These touchpoints are
            currently implemented at the Object Class, Property,
            Representation Term, Value Domain and Valid Value
            levels of the metadata model.
