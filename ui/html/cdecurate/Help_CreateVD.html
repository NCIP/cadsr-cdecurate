            The Curation Tool provides you with the ability to
            create and edit Value Domains, validate the Value
            Domains`s attributes, and submit (i.e. store) the
            Value Domains in the NCI`s Cancer Data Standards
            Repository (caDSR) database.

          <!-- Create New Value Domain Screen Overview  -->Like
          other primary functions of the Curation Tool Creating
          Value Domain is accessed via the dark blue Navigation
          Bar at the top of the screen. You may also want to
          create a new Value Domain using an existing Value
          Domain as a starting template. Or you may want to
          version an existing Value Domain. Both of these options
          can be accessed via the <b><span class=

          <p>
            Users now have the ability to filter their search for
            Value Domains by Exact Version and Conceptual Domain.
            The text field for entering Exact Version is located
            next to the 'All' and 'Latest' Version radio buttons
            in the Search interface. Enter the exact version
            number of the Value Domain into the text field.
            Version number should be entered as a positive
            number, with or without a decimal.<br>
            <br>
            Filter by a specific Conceptual Domain by selecting
            the desired Conceptual Domain from the drop-down list
            in the 'Filter By' section of the Search interface.

            <br>
            An Enumerated Domain is a Value Domain that is
            specified by a list of all of its Permissible Values.
            An example of an Enumerated Value Domain is
            CountryValue:U,C,M. The Value Domain of Country Value
            is specified by a list of Permissible Values (U means
            USA, C means Canada, and M means Mexico).<br>
            <br>
            A Non-Enumerated Domain is specified by a description
            rather than a list of all Permissible Values. A
            non-enumerated value domain requires a name, a
            definition, an identifier, and a description of
            appropriate values. An example of a Non-enumerated
            Value Domain (taken from ISO/IEC 11179) is
            'Probabilities-5 significant digits', with a
            description of 'all real numbers greater than 0 and
            less than 1 represented with 5-digit precision' and a
            precision of '5 digits to the right of the decimal
            point'.

          </h4>
          <p>
            The ISO 11179 Standard describes a Value Domain as ?a
            set of values?. A Data Element is associated with
            only one Value Domain, and the name of the Value
            Domain describes all of the data values that are
            included in that domain.<br>
            <br>
            For example a Data Element of
            'PatientPlaceOfBirthValue' has an Enumerated Value
            Domain of 'Country Value: U,C,M'.

            <span class="figureText">What is an Object
            Class</span><br>
            <span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">The ISO 11179
            Standard describes an Object Class as a set of ideas,
            abstractions, or things in the real world that can be
            identified with explicit boundaries and meaning and
            whose properties and behavior follow the same rules.
            In other words, Object Classes are the things about
            which you want to store and collect data. Examples of
            Object Classes include cars, persons, households,
            employees, etc. For the example of
            PatientPlaceOfBirth, an Object class is
            Patient.</span>

            <span class="figureText">What is a
            Property</span><br>
            The ISO 11179 Standard describes a Property as a
            peculiarity common to all members of an object class.
            In other words, properties are what humans use to
            describe or distinguish Objects. For the example
            given above, a Property is PlaceOfBirth.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="figureText">What is a Representation
            Term</span><br>
            The ISO 11179 Standard describes a representation
            class term as a mechanism by which the functional
            and/or presentational category of an item may be
            conveyed to the user'. The following are examples of
            representation class terms: amount, average, count,
            code, date, measure, name, number, quantity and rate.
            For the same example of PatientPlaceOfBirth, a
            Representation Term is Value.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Object Class, Property, and Qualifier Concepts
            and Primary Concept of the Representation Term are
            used to facilitate the naming of the Value Domain.
            Although each of these act as building blocks for the
            Value Domain's name and definition, only the
            Qualifier Concepts and Primary Concept (that form the
            Rep Term Long Name) are captured as being related to
            the Value Domain. The Object Class and Property will
            not be captured therefore they will not appear when
            editing the Value Domain.

            Search for Building Blocks

          <p>
            Searching for Building Blocks is very similar to
            searching for any other Administered Component. The
            first step in naming a Value Domain is to search for

          <p>
            Searching for Building Blocks using the regular Term
            Search is very similar to searching for any other
            Administered Component. The first step in naming a
            Value Domain is to search for and choose the optional
            building blocks (Primary and Qualifier Concepts for
            Object Class and Property) that will ultimately
            comprise the Value Domain Long Name.

          remember that the caDSR database has a 30 character

          the NCI Thesaurus or Metathesaurus that is LONGER than

            Use the "Tree Search" hyperlink to access a

            first appears all of the NCI Thesaurus Root Concepts
            will appear on the left side of the screen. Each Root
            Concept may have one or more Subconcepts. A Concept's
            Subconcepts may be seen by clicking on the plus sign
            next to the Concept name. Some Subconcepts will have
            Subconcepts of their own which may be seen by
            clicking on a plus sign that appears next to the
            Subconcept name. If no plus sign appears then the
            Subconcept has no Subconcepts of its own.
          </p>
          <p>
            To select a Root Concept or Subconcept, click on its
            name. The Concept's details will appear in the Search
            Results window to the right. The Concept may appear
            more than once if it has multiple definitions. There
            will be one row for each definition. If no definition
            is associated with the Concept, the definition field
            will read &lsquo;No Value Exists.&rsquo;
          </p>
          <p>
            Once Concepts appear in the Search Results area, one
            may be selected by clicking on the check box next to
            its Concept Name. When a Concept is selected in this
            way several options are enabled. The Concept may be
            used for your Data Element Concept by clicking on the
            &lsquo;Use Selection&rsquo; button above the search
            results. A Concept's Subconcepts may be retrieved to
            the Search Results area by clicking on one of the
            selections from the &lsquo;Get Subconcepts&rsquo;
            button. You may get only the immediate Subconcepts or
            all Subconcepts regardless of how far down the tree
            they may be. A third option is to retrieve all of the

            These suggestions are made up of the building blocks
            you selected in the previous step. The Long Name
            field will contain the full names of the selected

            There are three options for creating a Value Domain

            the default System Generated Short Name. This name
            will be a combination of the Rep Term Public ID and
            Version, although the Short Name field will simply
            say (Generated by the System). If you want you may
            select an Abbreviated Short Name. This Short Name
            type will consiste of the first four letters of each
            building block Concept selected, separated by the
            character _. If the Prefered Name is longer than 30
            characters it will be truncated to 30 characters. The
            final Short Name option is Existing Name (editable).
            When you choose this otion you type a Short Name into
            the field, up to the 30 character limit. If you
            selected no Rep Term Concepts you must use an

            Conceptual Domains are plural, object oriented,

            <br>
            Please note that a Value Domain cannot have a
            Workflow Status of Released unless its Rep Term also
            has Workflow Statuses of Released. It should be a
            very rare for this to be a problem. However, if it
            does occur you must update the Rep Term Workflow
            Status using the caDSR Administration Tool as there
            is no mechanism for changing the Rep Term Workflow
            Statuses in the CDE Curation Tool.

            (Enumerated Only)
          </h4>
          <p>
            Before you can submit a new Permissible Value to the
            caDSR, it must be in the appropriate format, with the
            appropriate content and relationships between
            attributes. The CDE Curation Tool provides you with a
            Validation function for ensuring that Permissible
            Values are unique and in the appropriate format.
          </p>
          <p>
            To begin the Validate Permissible Value process,
            select either the Validate button from the menu at
            the top of the screen, or the Validate link at the
            bottom.

          <p>
            Classification Schemes (CS) are a way of grouping
            Value Domains based on common characteristics.
            Classifications also help add information about Value
            Domains that is not easily included in definitions.
            For example, you might want to classify Value Domains
            as belonging to the Classification Scheme Type of
            Disease. A Classification Scheme Item (CSI) is a
            component of content in a Classification Scheme (i.e.
            Liver Cancer).<br>
            <br>
            The parent-child relationship of Classification
            Scheme Items are displayed in a hierarchical order
            and indicated by indentations. Child Classification
            Scheme Items are indented farther than their parent.
            This is a new feature for version 3.0 of the CDE
            Curation Tool.<br>
            <br>
            Note that when you select a Classification Scheme
            Item that has parents then all of the parent and
            grandparent Classification Scheme Items will also be
            selected. This is a new feature for version 3.0 of
            the CDE Curation Tool.<br>
            Once selected, Classification Schemes and
            Classification Scheme Items can be removed by
            highlighting the desired item and then clicking the
            RemoveItembutton.

          <p>
            Before you can submit a new Value Domain to the
            caDSR, it must be in the appropriate format, with the
            appropriate content and relationships between
            attributes. The CDE Curation Tool provides you with a
            Validation function for Creating and Editing all
            available Administered Components (Data Elements,
            Data Element Concepts, and Value Domains).<br>
            <br>
            To begin the validate Value Domain process, select
            either the Validate button at the top of the screen
            or one of the Validate hyperlinks.<br>
