<hr>
<p>A wealth of clinical and scientific and clinical research data
exists within the cancer research community. The NCI's Center for
Bioinformatics has developed an evolving core infrastructure
designed to provide the ability to seamlessly translate and
interchange semantically immutable information. The caCORE
infrastructure provides researchers, developers and statisticians
with the ability to plug their existing data, sources and methods
into a standardized sharable framework that supports information
exchange, regardless of source, location or format.</p>
<p>Different biomedical domains have their own terminologies and
ontological resources, each focused on different concepts within
their domain. A common terminology is the foundation for
interoperability between systems, indexing repositories of
information, and querying and integrating information sources
across research areas. The Enterprise Vocabulary Services (EVS)
is a set of vocabulary resources that are being used to provide a
common terminology across the cancer research domain, improving
communication between the people, organizations, data and data
sources in it.</p>
<p>NCICB's clinical trials informatics efforts draw on EVS
whenever domain terminology is required. This reliance on
controlled vocabulary ensures that term meanings remain clear and
can be related to other terms with similar concepts.</p>
<p>The EVS Project is a collaborative effort of the Center for
Bioinformatics and the NCI Office of Communications. EVS includes
Distributed Terminology System (DTS) Vocabularies and the NCI
Metathesaurus. The DTS Vocabulary include:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>NCI Thesaurus:</b> a biomedical thesaurus created
specifically to meet the needs of the NCI, is produced by the NCI
EVS project. This knowledgebase contains the working vocabulary
used in NCI data systems. It covers clinical, translational and
basic research as well as administrative terminology. <
					</li>
<li><b>GO:</b> GO Ontology, published by the Gene Ontology
Consortium.</li>
<li><b>VA NDFRT:</b> Published by the US Veterans'
Administration, the National Drug File Reference Terminology
covers clinical drugs used at the VA.</li>
<li><b>LOINC:</b> Published by the Regenstrief Institute, the
Logical Observation Identifier Names and Codes covers clinical
laboratory terminology. 
					</li>
<li><b>MGED Ontology:</b> The MGED (Microarray Gene Expression
Data)Ontology, produced by the MGED Society, contains concepts,
definitions, terms, and resources for standardized description of
a microarray experiment in support of MAGE v.1. The MGED ontology
is divided into the MGED Core ontology which is intended to be
stable and in synch with MAGE v.1; and the MGED Extended ontology
which adds further associations and classes not found in MAGE
v.1.</li>
<li><b>MedDRA:</b> MedDRA (Medical Dictionary for Regulatory
Activities) is an international medical terminology developed
under the auspices of the International Conference on
Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Registration of
Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH).</li>
<li><b>SnoMed:</b> SnoMed is the universal health care
terminology maintained by SNOMED&reg; International, a division
of the College of American Pathologists (CAP).</li>
</ul>
The EVS Project also produces the NCI Metathesaurus, which is
based on NLM's Unified Medical Language System Metathesaurus
supplemented with additional cancer-centric vocabulary. The
public version of NCI Metathesaurus currently contains all public
domain vocabularies from the National Library of Medicine's UMLS
Metathesaurus, as well as a growing number of NCI-specific
vocabularies developed by the National Cancer Institute.<br>
<br>
In the CDE Curation Tool, the EVS Vocabularies can be searched
for primary and qualifier concepts that can be used to create
both the names and definitions for Object Class, Property, and
Representation Terms. These are the building blocks for Data
Element Concepts and Value Domains. EVS Vocabularies are also
searched when creating Permissible Values and Value Meanings as
well as when creating the defections for any of the administered
items listed above, plus Data Elements.

<h4>Search EVS</h4>
<p>The NCI Thesaurus and Metathesaurus search screen is accessed
by clicking the search link either above the individual building
block (i.e. Object class, Property or Representation Term), next
to the definition field on the Data Element, Data Element Concept
or Value Domain create or edit screens, and next to the Select
Parent Concept to Constrain Permissible Values field on the Value
Domain create or edit screen. Following are detailed instructions
about how to search the NCI Thesaurus and Metathesaurus.
<span class="figureText">Figure 1</span> is an overview of the
EVS Search screen when searching for a definition. All search
screens have similar layouts and functionality.</p>
<p class="centeredImage"><img alt="image001 (38K)" src="Assets/Help/EVS/image001.png" class="screenShot" height="723" width="839" /></p>
<p class="imageText">FIGURE 1<br>
Search for an EVS Concept Definition</p>
<p><strong>1)</strong> Enter Search Term.</p>
<p><strong>2)</strong> Start Search.</p>
<p><strong>3)</strong> Results are displayed in table format.</p>
<p>Once you have searched for a concept and identified the one
you would like to use, simply check the box next to that term and
click on the &lsquo;Use Selection&rsquo; button at the top of the
search screen.</p>
<p>Search for Naming Components (NEW Tree Search/Include,
Qualifier Concepts, and Primary Concepts)</p>
<p>Data Element Concepts are named by combining Primary and
Qualifier Concepts for Object Classes and Properties. Value
Domains are named by combining Primary and Qualifier Concepts for
Representation Term. These are then used for naming the Data
Element Concept and Value Domain. This approach is new for
version 3.0 of the CDE Curation Tool.<br>
<br></p>
<h4>Naming a Data Element Concept</h4>
<p>Object Classes and Properties are the building blocks from
which a Data Element Concept name is made. When creating a new
Data Element Concept the use of Object Classes and Properties is
strongly encouraged but not strictly mandatory. The CDE Curation
Tool enables you to search caDSR and the NCI EVS (Enterprise
Vocabulary Services) for for Concepts. The Primary Concepts may
represent existing Object Classes and Properties, or Concepts may
be combined to create new Object Classes and Properties. Object
Class and Property Long Names are also created from this
interface.<br>
<br>
An Object Class or Property may consist of one Primary Concept
and one or more Qualifier Concepts. Each of these Concepts must
be selected separately. Once selected the Concept's source
database and Concept Code will be shown below the Concept. You
may highlight Qualifier Concepts one at a time to see their
source database and Concept Code.<br>
<br>
The Object Class and Property Long Names will be constructed from
the names of the Qualifier and Primary Concepts that have been
chosen. The Long Name will be built left to right starting with
the Concept at the top of the Qualifier Concepts list and ending
with the Primary Concept. Once you have built the Object Class
and Property Long Names they are not editable.<br>
<br>
Please note that if you select only a Primary Concept from the
caDSR database and select no Qualifier Concepts you have in
effect selected an existing Object Class (or Property). In this
case, no new Object Class (or Property) will be created in caDSR
when you submit your Data Element Concept.<br>
<br></p>
<h4>Naming a Value Domain</h4>
<p>Representation Term is the building block from which a Value
Domain name is made. When creating a new Value Domain, the use of
a Representation Term is strongly encouraged but not strictly
mandatory. The CDE Curation Tool enables you to search caDSR and
the NCI EVS (Enterprise Vocabulary Services) for for Concepts.
The Primary Concepts may represent existing Representation Terms,
or Concepts may be combined to create a new Representation Term.
The Representation Term Long Name is also created from this
interface.<br>
<br>
A Representation Term may consist of one Primary Concept and one
or more Qualifier Concepts. Each of these must be selected
separately. Once selected the Concept's source database and
Concept Code will be shown below the Concept. You may highlight
Qualifier Concepts one at a time to see their source database and
Concept Code.<br>
<br>
The Representation Term Long Names will be constructed from the
names of the Qualifier and Primary Concepts that have been
chosen. The Long Name will be built left to right starting with
the Object Class and ending with the Primary Concept. Once you
have built the Representation Term Long Name, it is not editable.
Optionally, a user may choose to search for Object Class and
Properties to assist in the creation of a Value Domain's Long
Name.<br>
<br>
Please note that if you select only a Primary Concept from the
caDSR database and select no Qualifier Concepts you have in
effect selected an existing Representation Term. In this case, no
new Representation Term will be created in caDSR when you submit
your Value Domain.</p>
<span class="standOutHeading">Search for Building Blocks (Primary
and Qualifier Concepts) via Term Search</span>
<hr>
<p>Searching for Building Blocks using the regular Term Search is
very similar to searching for any other Administered Component.
The first step is to search for and choose the optional building
blocks (Primary and Qualifier Concepts) that will ultimately
comprise the Administered Component Long Name.<br>
<br>
As a new fewature for version 3.0 you may restrict your search to
exclude Retired Concepts, or you may include all Concepts in your
search.</p>
<p>Once you have entered your search term and started your
search, the Search Results screen will appear to the right of the
search criteria. Next to each concept that is returned is a check
box. In order to use a term that you have identified, check the
box next to it, then click the &lsquo;Use Selection&rsquo; button
at the top of the screen.</p>
<p><span class="standOutHeading">Search for Building Blocks
(Primary and Qualifier Concepts) via Tree Search - (NEW
FEATURE)</span></p>
<hr>
<p>You may also search for Concepts in the NCI Thesaurus portion
of EVS using a tree-based seach that is new for version 3.0. To
access the tree-based search click on the &lsquo;Tree
Search&rsquo; hyperlink in the &lsquo;Search In:&rsquo; section
of the search screen.</p>
<p class="centeredImage"><img alt="image002 (5K)" src="Assets/Help/EVS/image002.png" class="screenShot" height="139" width="282" /></p>

i</span> Click here to use the EVS tree-based search to find
Naming Components and Concepts.</p>
<p>When the Tree Search first appears all of the NCI Thesaurus
Root Concepts will appear on the left side of the screen. Each
Root Concept may have one or more Subconcepts. A Concept's
Subconcepts may be seen by clicking on the plus sign next to the
Concept name. Some Subconcepts will have Subconcepts of their own
which may be seen by clicking on a plus sign that appears next to
the Subconcept name. If no plus sign appears then the Subconcept
has no Subconcepts of its own.<br>
<br>
To select a Root Concept or Subconcept, click on its name. The
Concept's details will appear in the Search Results window to the
right. The Concept may appear more than once if it has multiple
definitions. There will be one row for each definition. If no
definition is associated with the Concept, the definition field
will read &lsquo;No Value Exists.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
Once Concepts appear in the Search Results area, one may be
selected by clicking on the check box next to its Concept Name.
When a Concept is selected in this way several options are
enabled. The Concept may be used for your Data Element Concept by
clicking on the &lsquo;Use Selection&rsquo; button above the
search results. A Concept's Subconcepts may be retrieved to the
Search Results area by clicking on one of the selections from the
&lsquo;Get Subconcepts&rsquo; button. You may get only the
immediate Subconcepts or all Subconcepts regardless of how far
down the tree they may be. A third option is to retrieve all of
the selected Concept's Superconcepts by clicking on the
&lsquo;Get Superconcepts&rsquo; button.</p>
<p class="centeredImage"><img alt="image003 (34K)" src="Assets/Help/EVS/image003.png" class="screenShot" height="674" width="841" /></p>

i</span> When selecting a Concept to use as an Object Class,
Property or Qualifier, it is important to remember that the caDSR
database has a 30 character limit on building blocks. If you
choose a Concept from the NCI Thesaurus or Metathesaurus that is
LONGER than 30 characters, the CDE Curation Tool will
automatically truncate that Concept to 30 characters.</p>
<p><span class="standOutHeading">Select a Parent Concept for
Referenced Value Domains</span></p>
<hr>
<p>Value Domains may be referenced to EVS Concepts or other
vocabulary source by constraining values to an EVS Parent Concept
or by referencing the Value Domain to a non-EVS vocabulary.<br>
<br>
The first step in this process is to search for a Parent Concept
as illustrated in <span class="figureText">Figures 4 and 5</span>
