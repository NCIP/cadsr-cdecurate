            Most of the primary functions of the Common Data
            Element (CDE) Curation Tool are accessed via the dark
            blue Navigation Bar at the top of the screen. To
            begin the Create New Data Element Concept process,
            Select <b><span class="navigation">Create <span
            class="then">&agrave;</span> Data Element Concept
            <span class="then">&agrave;</span> New</span></b>

            <br>
             You may also want to create a new Data Element
            Concept using an existing Data Element Concept as a
            starting template. Or you may want to version an
            existing Data Element Concept. Both of these options
            can be accessed via the <b><span class=

            "then">&agrave;</span> Data Element
            Concept</span></b> menu in the Navigation Bar.

            The ISO 11179 Standard describes a Data Element
            Concept as the combination of an Object Class, a
            Property, and Qualifiers for each. Definitions for
            each of these terms are documented below.

            Concept?</span><br>
             The ISO/IEC 11179 Standard describes a Data Element
            Concept as relating several data elements that record
            data about that concept with different
            representations. For example, a concept of
            PatientPlaceOfBirth is a Data Element Concept.<br>
            <br>
             A Data Element Concept is composed of an Object
            Class, a Property and optional Qualifiers for
            both.

             The ISO 11179 Standard describes an Object Class as
            &lsquo;a set of ideas, abstractions, or things in the
            real world that can be identified with explicit
            boundaries and meaning and whose properties and
            behavior follow the same rules&rsquo;. In other
            words, Object Classes are the &lsquo;things about
            which you want to store and collect data.&rsquo;
            Examples of Object Classes include cars, persons,
            households, employees, etc. For the example of
            PatientPlaceOfBirth, an Object class is Patient.

            &lsquo;a peculiarity common to all members of an
            object class&rsquo;. In other words, properties are
            &lsquo;what humans use to describe or distinguish
            Objects&rsquo;. For the example given above, a
            Property is PlaceOfBirth.

             The ISO 11179 Standard describes qualifiers as being
            used to &lsquo;differentiate between names (i.e.
            Object Class and Property combinations) that would
            otherwise be the same&rsquo;. For the example of
            PatientPlaceOfBirth, a Qualifier of year is used to
            indicate a specific year.<br>

            Data Element Concepts are named by combining 
						Primary and Qualifier Concepts for Object Classes and Properties. The Object
						Classes and Properties are then used for naming the Data Element 
						Concept. This approach is new for version 3.0 of the CDE Curation Tool.
						Building Blocks for Object Classes and Properties<br>
						<br>
            Object Classes and Properties are the building
						blocks from which a Data Element Concept name is made. When creating a 
						new Data Element Concept the use of Object Classes and Properties is 
						strongly encouraged but not strictly mandatory. The CDE Curation Tool 
						enables you to search caDSR and the NCI EVS (Enterprise Vocabulary Services) for
						for Concepts. The Primary Concepts may represent existing Object Classes 
						and Properties, or Concepts may be combined to create new Object Classes and
						Properties. <span class="figureText">Figure 4</span> shows the interface to 
						search for Concepts for Object Classes and Properties. 
						Object Class and Property Long Names are also created from this interface.<br>
						<br>
						An Object Class or Property may consist of one Primary Concept and one
						or more Qualifier Concepts. Each of these Concepts must be selected
						separately. Once selected the Concept's source database and Concept Code will
						be shown below the Concept. You may highlight Qualifier Concepts one at a 
						time to see their source database and Concept Code.<br>
						<br>
						The Object Class and Property Long Names will be constructed
						from the names of the Qualifier and Primary Concepts that have been
						chosen. The Long Name will be built left to right starting with the Concept
						at the top of the Qualifier Concepts list and ending with the Primary
						Concept. Once you have built the Object Class and Property Long Names they
						are not editable.<br>
						<br>
						Please note that if you select only a Primary Concept from the caDSR database
						and select no Qualifier Concepts you have in effect selected an existing
						Object Class (or Property). In this case, no new Object Class (or Property)
						will be created in caDSR when you submit your Data Element Concept.

            Searching for Building Blocks using the regular Term Search is very similar to
            searching for any other Administered Component. The
            first step in naming a Data Element Concept is to
            search for and choose the optional building blocks
            (Primary and Qualifier Concepts for Object Class and Property) that will
            ultimately comprise the Data Element Concept Long Name.<br>
						<br>As a new fewature for version 3.0 you may restrict your search to
						exclude Retired Concepts, or you may include all Concepts in your search.<br>

            definitions. For example, you might want to classify
            Data Element Concepts as belonging to the

            Classification Scheme Item is a component of content

            Before you can submit a new Data Element Concept to
            the caDSR, it must be in the appropriate format, with
            the appropriate content and relationships between
            attributes. The CDE Curation Tool provides you with a
            Validation function for Creating and Editing all
            available Administered Components (Data Elements,
            Data Element Concepts, and Value Domains).

             If any attributes are invalid, the Validation screen
            will indicate in what way the attribute is invalid
            and the Submit button will be disabled. Invalid
            attributes can be corrected by going back to the
            Block Edit screen and modifying the values of the
            attributes. <span class="red"><b>NOTE:</b></span>
